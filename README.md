# python discord bot-17.12.21

Was this bot made in 2020, maybe early? I just coded it for a personal server, it still works flawlessly because it's a very basic bot and I'm not going to change a single line of code so I can see what I've done. YOU CAN USE IT, BUT REMEMBER I DON'T DO MAINTENANCE! Oh, it plays songs through ytdl, fantastic! Hum, it is in portuguese too.
