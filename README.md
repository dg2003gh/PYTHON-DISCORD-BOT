# python discord bot-17.12.21

Was this bot made in 2020, maybe early? I just coded it for a personal server, it still works very well for a very basic bot. I didn't change a single line of code to see what I did when I was in school haha. YOU CAN USE IT, BUT I DON'T  MAINTENANCE IT SINCE 2021! and... it's in Portuguese(I don't know why but I commented EVERY COMMAND AS IF I WAS CODING THE HARDEST CODE people would ever see HAHAHA).
