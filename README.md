# python discord bot

Was this bot made in 2020, maybe early? I coded it for a personal server, it still works great for a very basic bot. I didn't change a single line of code to see what I did when I was in school... YOU CAN USE IT, BUT I DON'T MAINTENANCE IT SINCE 2021 (I just updated python, ytdl, ffmepeg...)! It's in Portuguese and I don't know why but I commented EVERY COMMAND AS IF I WAS CODING THE HARDEST CODE people have ever seen HAHAHA.
